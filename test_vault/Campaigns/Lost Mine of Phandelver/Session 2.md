# Summary
Starting at the entrance to the cave Seraphim and Vistra sneaked their way into the cave. Vistra commanded a wolf to be friendly and broke it free to aid them. Seraphim went ahead to investigate the voices coming from a side passage. Peeking around a corner she saw a large group of goblins. When Vistra and a now friendly appeared they attacked. Shortly after the attack began and after seeing a goblin be beheaded by a wolf [[Yeemik]] tried to enter into a truce, whereupon Vistra instead tried to explain how he really didn't want to be leader.. something, something Freud. Yeemik so confused decided to stop the attack but let [[Sildar Hallwinter]] fall off the ledge. Vistra stabilises and they drag him out of the cave. 

After a long rest he tells the party this: 

> [!info]
> - The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver’s Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the “[Background](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop/introduction#Background)” section to the players at this time.)
> - Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn’t know who or what the Black Spider is.
> - Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn’t know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn’t occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle’s location. See the “[What the Goblins Know](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop/goblin-arrows#WhatTheGoblinsKnow)” sidebar above.)
> - Sildar’s contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords’ Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.
