# Summary
After meeting in [[Neverwinter]], [[Vistra Rockseeker]] and [[Seraphim]] head off on their journey to protect the wagon full of provisions. A little into their journey they find a pile of dead horses with black arrows sticking out the side, and they recognise the horses as belonging to [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and a soldier named [[Sildar Hallwinter]]. They are then ambushed, take some damage but eventually [[Seraphim]] is able to bribe the goblins to leave them alone. After some deliberation and a quick rest they follow their trail and come to the Goblin Hideout.
