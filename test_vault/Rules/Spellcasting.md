# Spell Levels
Every spell has an associated spell level it must be cast at. The higher the level the more powerful the spell. The higher the spell level the higher the player level needs to be to cast it (although not necessarily synced levels).

# Prepared Spells
To use a spell (during combat or otherwise) a spell caster must have previously prepared that spell. Prepares spells can only be changed after a [[Rests#Long Rest|Long Rest]],

# Spell Slots
Spell casters can only cast a limited number of spells between rests. Each character sheet should have the number of spell slots per [[#Spell Levels]] a character can cast between resting.

# Cantrips
Cantrips are simple level 0 spells, they do not take a spell slot and can be cast at anytime without preparing them.

# Components
A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.

## Verbal 
Spells with this component must have some words associated with the casting. If the player is gagged or in an area of silence such as the one created by the [[Silence]] spell, you can't cast this spell verbally.

## Somatic
Spellcasting gestures might include the a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform the gesture.

## Material
Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A component pouch includes all the needed material components to cast spells, except those that have a gold piece cost show in the spell.A cleric's holy symbol replaces material components, again excepting those with a gold piece cost. If a cost is indicated a character must purchase that specific component before casting the spell in question. If a spell specifies that the material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic component.
