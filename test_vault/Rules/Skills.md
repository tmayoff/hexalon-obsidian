Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

# Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

## Strength Checks
A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

### Athletics
Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
-   You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
-   You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
-   You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

### Other Strength Checks
The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
-   Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
-   Break free of bonds
-   Push through a tunnel that is too small
-   Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
-   Tip over a statue
-   Keep a boulder from rolling

## Strength Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

## Lifting and Carrying

# Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

## Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

### Acrobatics
Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

### Sleight of Hand
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

### Stealth
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

### Other Dexterity Checks
The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
-   Steer a chariot around a tight turn
-   Pick a lock
-   Disable a trap
-   Securely tie up a prisoner
-   Wriggle free of bonds
-   Play a stringed instrument
-   Craft a small or detailed object

## Dexterity Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

## Armour Class
Depending on the armour you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armour Class.

## Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.

## Hiding
