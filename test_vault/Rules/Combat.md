# Surprise
A creature can be surprised by another creature who is currently stealthing. If neither side is being stealthy there is no surprise. Otherwise, the DM compares the [[Skills#Dexterity|Dexterity]] (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the [[Skills#Passive Wisdom|Passive Wisdom]] (Perception) of the opposing side. Any character that doesn't notice a threat is surprised for the beginning of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends.

# Initiative
Initiative determines the turn order in combat. At the beginning of the encounter everyone makes a [[Ability Checks|dexterity check]] check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, each member of the group act at the same time.
