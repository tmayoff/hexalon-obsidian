As Dungeon Master I can reward players for role playing their characters well. 

Each character should have some **traits**, **ideals**, **bonds**, and **flaws** that help guide the player to act as their character would. When a player makes a decision (positive or negative) that holds true to their character then the DM can choose to reward them with inspiration.

# Mechanics
Mechanically this is used to gain [[Advantage]] on [[Ability Checks]], [[Attack Rolls]], or [[Saving Throws]]. This can also be used to counteract disadvantage on rolls.

# Personality Traits
These provide a glimpse into the characters likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears and mannerisms. 

# Ideals
An ideal is something the character believes in and strives for above all else

# Bonds
A bond represents a person, place or event in the world that the player cares about. Someone they care about, a place that holds a special connection or a treasured possession.

# Flaws
Something someone else can use to exploit your character to
