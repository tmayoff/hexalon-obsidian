# Invisibility
This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become [[Dungeons & Dragons/Rules/Conditions#Invisible]] for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is [[Dungeons & Dragons/Rules/Conditions#Invisible]] with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
